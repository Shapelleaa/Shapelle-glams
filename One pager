I would like to create an app that teaches you how to do your makeup called “Shapelle Glam’s”. You’re probably wondering why makeup? Well for starters it’s become a hobby of mine and there’s a lot of women out there especially in the 16-25 age group that have no idea how to do their makeup. So, the desired outcome is for this app to have an avatar in the skin tone of the user’s choice giving a step-by-step tutorial on what to do as well as the best product to use to get the job done.  I think the best way to measure success is by having the user’s rate how helpful the app may have been after they’ve used it.  And I know what you’re thinking, there’s already thousands of tik toks and youtube videos showing women how to do their makeup. However, what those videos lack are the why they do their makeup like so. For example, I started perfecting my makeup skills when I was 13. I would be on youtube for hours watching the most random makeup tutorials trying to perfect my craft. And of course, the women would show me what they’re doing and maybe even tell me the name of the product, but they never explained to me why I should put on foundation first or why using a particular concealer from a brand was the best option for me, which evidently caused the learning process to take so much longer than it needed to. So with ‘Shapelle Glam’s” not only will you be shown how to do your makeup, you’ll also understand why you should do your makeup a certain way which will create a better and quicker learning experience for everyone. If this project failed I believe it would be because of the popularity of other apps like Tik Tok and Youtube.
